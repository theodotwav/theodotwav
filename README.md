## Hello! My name is Theo!

I am a beginner programmer, my dream project is Imagik (could change to Neoblox)

I'm currently learning Python to then learn Java to finally learn C++.
I am working on a Python Roulette game using pygame! (still mainly textbased tho)
I don't have much to add here, might add more later if I even remember about my github account lolmfao
